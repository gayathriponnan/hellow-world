FORTUNE TIME 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 " FORTUNE TIME "  is the simple and interesting game developed based on c program, which provides the fortune points and the qoutes of the day for the user who is playing this game. this program ask player to enter the number between 0 and 6. if the user entered number other than this it will show a "enter a valid number" message. once the user entered a valid number program generates a random number based on the present time. Already i have stored numbers from 1 to 5 in an array called a[] .Each index in array contains some fortune points and one of the value have no points and the another one value provide another chance to play the game. Based on the random number generated the value of the array gets rotated and hence the value's index keep on changing for each time when player starts the game.
After rearrangement, it checks the user entered number with the index of the array. When both the user's number and the value in the array  are equal it takes the corresponding index of the value in an array. It will show the points and quotes saved in the corresponding index as output. since the random number os generated based on the current time and provide the fortune points and quotes according to it, it is called "FORTUNE TIME".
